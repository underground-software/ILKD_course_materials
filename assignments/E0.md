## E0 - The Big Upgrade ðŸŽ¢

Build, install, and boot the latest Linux kernel fresh off Linus Torvaldsâ€™ tree.

#### Outcomes:

* Set up a kernel development environment

* Get comfortable with building the kernel

#### What to submit:

* Patch 1 adds `username/E0/E0.txt` and answers question 1 before compiling the kernel

* Patch 2 modifies `username/E0/E0.txt` answering all questions after booting into your new kernel

* Don't forget a cover letter

* All patches are expected to pass `checkpatch.pl` as described in the [policies and procedures](/procedures.md)

* Submit your patches to `exercise0@COURSE_DOMAIN`

#### Procedure:

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Some students have been running into an issue where 30G is insufficient
to compile the kernel with `ccache`. We apologize for the inconvenience, but it is **highly recommended** to add an additional
virtual hard drive to your VM and extend the logical volume as described in
[this tutorial](https://fedoramagazine.org/add-storage-to-your-fedora-system-with-lvm/).
We would recommend adding at least an additional 20G of space, for a total of 50G.

If you run out of disk space in the middle of compilation, you'll almost certainly have to
delete files to free up enough space to resize your filesystem, which would likely
mean running `make clean` and losing your progress in the compilation.

0. First, make a copy of `E0.txt` in the `yourname/E0` directory and include the output of `uname -a` as the answer to question 1. Commit these changes before you compile the kernel.
<br><br>
Note that your editor likely allows you to directly dump the output of commands into `E0.txt`
In `nano` this is accomplished via `ctrl+t`, and in `vim` you would use `:r!` command.

0. Install the requisite dependencies. On Fedora, you can use

        sudo dnf builddep kernel

    which is roughly equivalent to

        sudo dnf -y install gcc flex make bison openssl openssl-devel elfutils-libelf-devel ncurses-devel bc git tar dwarves

    It's also recommended to install ccache to speed up subsequent kernel builds
by running

        sudo dnf -y install ccache
    *Be sure to restart your terminal after installing ccache
so that it gets added to your path!*

0. Clone the v6.11 Linux kernel release from [git.kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git).
It's recommended to set `--depth=1` to minimize the download size.

        git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

    When this completes, change the current directory to the kernel tree with

        cd linux

0. Copy the kernel config for your running kernel to your kernel source tree with

        cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config

    and set any new config options to the defaults with

        make olddefconfig

0. Set a custom version tag for your kernel build.
Create a file named `localversion` in the `linux` directory and add something cool.
We suggest it begin with a '.' character, and it must NOT contain spaces.
For example, `cat localversion` might return

        .my-cool-kernel-version

    which will result in a kernel version like

        6.11.0.my-cool-kernel-version

0. Now, build the kernel by running

        make -j $(nproc)

    The `-j` option will invoke a parallel build using the number of threads specified.
The `$(nproc)` will resolve to the output of the `nproc` command,
which in turn will return the number of processor cores on your VM.
<br><br>
This will take a while.

0. Next, install the kernel modules for your newly build kernel onto your system.
The directories you will be writing to are owned by root,
so you need superuser permission (granted by wrapping your command with `sudo`)
in order to complete this step.

        sudo make -j $(nproc) modules_install

0. Finally, install the new kernel into your system's `/boot` directory. The same superuser considerations from the previous step apply.

        sudo make install

    When this completes, shutdown your VM.

        sudo shutdown now

0. Power on your system again. You should see a menu that looks roughly like the following:

	<img alt="grub bootloader image from https://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/fdocs/en-US/Documentation/0.1/html/Fedora_Multiboot_Guide/GRUB-runtime.html" src="/images/grub_menu.png"></img>

    As soon as it appears, hit the down arrow key to stop the countdown that will automatically boot the first selected menu entry in a couple of seconds.
Use the arrow keys to select your newly built kernel with your custom tag and hit enter when it is highlighted.

    * If you were running your VM in headless mode, boot your VM in normal mode so you can see the pre-OS bootloader


0. If you would like to set your new kernel as the default (i.e. it will boot automatically without selecting it at the menu), then use the following command to locate the index associated with your new kernel

        sudo grubby --info ALL

    Then, set the default to the index of your new kernel

        sudo grubby --set-default-index <index>

0. When you have booted into your new kernel and logged in, edit the copy of `E0.txt`
in the `yourname/E0` directory and answer all questions inside based on your new kernel.

0. Run the following commands and save their output for the assignment submission.

        uname -a

        sudo dmesg | head

0. Generate your patches (don't forget the cover letter!), make sure they pass
`checkpatch.pl`, and submit to `exercise0@COURSE_DOMAIN`.
