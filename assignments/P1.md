### P1 - Add a new system call ðŸ¤«

Add a new system call to the kernel

#### Outcomes:

* Get comfortable with the concept of a system call from both kernelspace and userspace

    * Learn how userspace programs make system calls

    * Learn how those calls are handled by the kernel

* Understand how C relates to assembly language

    * Write a C program to call your system call

    * Write the same program in the assembly language of your platform

#### What to submit:

* Patch 1 adds `username/P1/syscall.patch`, which patches the v6.11 kernel code to implement your system call

    * This patch adds the patch file you generated from the kernel repo *as a .patch file* to the course submissions repo

        * Note that this is the **only time** it is acceptable to submit a patch that contains whitespace errors as this is an artifact of committing an email code patch

        * Ignore the dashboard message about any detected whitespace errors

    * Generate a single patch from your commit to the Linux kernel using the command `git format-patch -1` within your linux repo

    * Take the `.patch` file outputted, and put it in your named directory (e.g. `cp 0001*.patch ~/ILKD_Submissions/your_name/P1/syscall.patch`)

    * Add *the email patch itself* as a file named `syscall.patch` to the staged git files and commit this

* Patch 2 adds `username/P1/syscall.c`, a C program which invokes your new system call, and `username/P1/Makefile`, which builds an executable named `syscall_C` via the default target

    * Make sure to have compiler warnings enabled (at least `-Wall` but ideally `-Wextra` and `-Wpedantic` too, or even `-Weverything` if you use clang)

    * Make sure that your code doesn't have any warnings or errors

* Patch 3 adds `username/P1/syscall.s`, an assembly program which invokes your new system call, and modifies `username/P1/Makefile` to build `syscall_asm` via the default target in addition to `syscall_C`

    * Edit the makefile to add rules for assembling and linking your assembly program using `as` and `ld`

    * You are welcome to leverage the C preprocessor when writing your assembly for e.g. includes, macro

    * If you do this, be sure to modify your makefile appropriately and use the correct file extension for your assembly source code

* Patch 4 adds `username/P1/strace.log`, which contains the output of running `strace` on your assembly program as it uses the new system call

* Don't forget a cover letter

* All email code patches are expected to pass `checkpatch.pl` as described in the [policies and procedures](/procedures.md)

* Submit your patches to programming1@COURSE_DOMAIN

#### Procedure:

0. Start by adding a new system call to your copy of the Linux kernel

    0. Create a new `.c` file in the `kernel` directory within the linux repo named `kdlp.c`

    0. Using the appropriately numbered `SYSCALL_DEFINE` macro, define a system call entry function for a new `kdlp` system call in the `kdlp.c` file that behaves as follows:

        * Takes two arguments, an argument of type `char __user *` to specify the buffer and an argument of type `size_t` to specify the size of the buffer

        * Formats a message into a local buffer that includes at least the student's name and the name of the current task that is running on the CPU (see the `get_task_comm` macro)

        * Determines the amount of data to send: equal to the lesser of the size of the kernel message and how much space the user provided (see `min` macro)

        * Copies that many bytes from the local message buffer into the user pointer (see the `copy_to_user` function)

        * Returns a negative error code of `-EFAULT` (errno 14, bad address) if the copy is not successful

        * Otherwise, returns the amount of data that was copied

    0. The system call implementation should take care to prevent any possibility of a buffer overflow

    0. Modify the makefile for the kernel subdirectory in `kernel/Makefile` to add `kdlp.o` to the list of objects that are always compiled (add it to the end of the `obj-y` variable)

    0. Add an `asmlinkage` declaration of `sys_kdlp` to the bottom of `include/linux/syscalls.h` (take inspiration from the numerous examples of other system calls in that file)

    0. Add an entry to the system call table for your architecture

        * On aarch64 the list comes from the modern shared table located in `include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h`

            * Find where `__NR_syscalls` is defined and increment the value

            * Just above that line, add a `#define` for `__NR_kdlp` with the next system call number that is free

            * add an invocation of the `__SYSCALL` macro with the `__NR_kdlp` number and and the `sys_kdlp` entry point

            * Take inspiration from the other nearby system calls

        * On x86-64, this is in a special table format located at `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl` for historical reasons

            * You need to pick a number for it, put it in order with the next highest number after the last `common` entry in the table

            * Your system call will be `common` (i.e. shared between 32 and 64 bit userspace programs transparently by the kernel)

            * The name is `kdlp` and the entry point is `sys_kdlp`

            * Take inspiration from the other nearby system calls

    0. Update the `localversion` file to create a distinct release string so you can tell this kernel that has your system call apart from the other kernel you compiled

    0. Update the config using `make oldconfig` (this should only take a few seconds, and shouldn't require you to answer any questions)

    0. Before compiling the entire kernel, you will find it helpful to compile your new kdlp.c file in isolation using `make kernel/kdlp.o`

    0. Compile your new kernel with `make -j $(nproc)`

    0. If the command finishes, make sure it was successful: `echo $?` should output `0`

        * If it does not, re-run `make` without `-j $(nproc)` to get a better error message

        * Fix whatever issue you see, and re-run `make -j $(nproc)`

        * Repeat this process of checking the result and fixing any errors until it compiles successfully

    0. Install your new kernel and its modules `sudo make -j $(nproc) modules_install install`

0. Reboot your VM and pick the new kernel

    * If all is well it should boot successfully

    * Congrats, you just wrote your first kernel code!

0. Make a patch out of your kernel code

    * Find all untracked files, and files you modified by looking at the output of `git status` within your linux kernel repository

    * Add them to the staging area with `git add` and then run `git commit -s` and provide a message

    * Format the resulting patch as a `.patch` file with `git format-patch -1`

        * You don't need `--rfc` or `-v1` or `--cover-letter` because this `.patch` is not getting emailed directly

    * Copy the `.patch` file into your named folder within the `P1` folder in the ILKD submissions repo

    * You can make your first commit for the assignment

0. Write a C program named `syscall.c` that invokes the new system call

    * This userspace program may only use `unistd.h`, `stdio.h`, and `stdilb.h` header files.

    * Use the `syscall(2)` function from the C standard library to invoke your system call

        * Pass the number you gave it in the table as the first argument and then pass the rest of the arguments

    * Check for any errors and print an appropriate message if they occur

    * Otherwise, print the message you received from the kernel using the `write(2)` system call

    * You can now make your second commit for the assignment

0. Write an assembly language program named `syscall.s` that behaves exactly the same as your C program with the following minor differences because you are not using the C standard library:

    * Your program starts at a label named `_start` instead of a function named `main`

    * You need to explicitly call the `exit` system call to terminate your program (trying to return from `_start` will segfault)

    * You explicitly invoke the system calls by following the conventions of the linux system call ABI (application binary interface)

        * For aarch64:

            * Arguments go into specific registers in order (`x0`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `x5`)

            * The system call number goes into `x8`

            * The system call is invoked using the `svc #0` instruction

            * The return value is in `x0` and is either a non-negative return value, or or negative error number (errno variable is a C library concept)

        * For x86-64:

            * Arguments go into specific registers in order (`%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%r10`, `%r8`, `%r9`)

            * The system call number goes into `%rax`

            * The system call is invoked using the `syscall` instruction

            * The return value is in `%rax` and is either a non-negative return value, or a negative error number (errno variable is a C library concept)

    * Make sure to update the makefile to assemble and link your program

    * You can now make your third commit for the assignment

0. Test your C program and assembly program

    * They should both print a message including your name and the name of executable file when you try them on the kernel you just compiled

    * Try running `strace` on your assembly program. Capture the output into a file using `2> strace_log` on the end of the command and add it to the repo as your fourth patch

    * You can also test the error case by booting into a kernel without your system call (i.e. the regular upstream kernel you compiled or the one packaged by fedora)

        * The kernel will return `-ENOSYS` to indicate that the system call is not implemented

        * Both programs should print some sort of error message and exit early with a nonzero code
