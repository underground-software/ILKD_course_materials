1. How does the kernel know a program is doing something illegal?
  1. Control flow for hardware exceptions
  1. Follow message from dmesg to hardware
  1. Other kinds of exceptions
    1. Traps: intentionally switch to kernel mode to run code but can return to where we left off
    1. Faults: go into kernel mode as side effect, e.g. page fault (normal and excepted if not in working set)
    1. Aborts: generally unrecoverable errors, double & triple faults or machine errors, OS bugs
  1. Exceptions are a type of interrupt, along with:
    1. hardware interrupts (IRQs: Interrupts Requests)
    1. software interrupts (IPIs: Inter-process interrupts)
