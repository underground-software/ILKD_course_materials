1. Important note about disk resizing is available in the matrix server

1. Today we will continue to build our minimal Linux distribution we began last class

1. Correction: though the QEMU option is `-initrd`, we are in fact using an `initramfs`

1. We will add busybox, which is a single binary containing many common Linux utilities

  1. First, we need to compile busybox as a static binary since we won't have a dynamic linker nor C library in our VM

  1. We can disable applet links and simply include the busybox binary to see how busybox works

  1. We can include the links to add back in all the familiar utilities

  1. However, we can't compile any new programs

1. Next, we will add a C compiler and C library

  1. We will use `tcc`, the tiny C compiler, since it is tiny

  1. We will use dietlibc as our C library, since it is also very small

1. Now, we have to compile and install these various components into a system root to put in our cpio archive for the initramfs

  1. Keep in mind, everything needs to be static

  1. We need to modify `tcc` to work with the C runtime provided by dietlibc since `tcc` expects a C library (e.g. glibc) containing multiple C runtime startup files

1. We will attempt to compile and run a hello world C program

  1. Inside our VM, we will need to make some re-arrangements to ensure `tcc` can find what it needs to compile our program

1. With our VM containing core utilities, a C compiler, and a C runtime, we have a minimal Linux distribution ready to roll
