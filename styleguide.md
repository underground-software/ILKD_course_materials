## Style Guide

### Title

  * Each document's first line is a `## Title` so that radius can grab it for the page's HTML `<title>` tag

### Paragraphs

  * Correct grammar and punctuation

### Bullet-point lists

  * Initial cap

  * <= 1 sentance

  * No period at the end

  * More than one sentance should be more than one bullet, or a paragraph

## Headings:

  * Title capitalization

## Markdown rules:

  * separate bullets by a blank line

  * when splitting single paragraphs/bullets try to find

  * a natural breaking point, but prefer avoiding jagged

  * edges to breaking strictly on clauses or something

  * spell out a number if it less than 20

  * larger numbers potentially if they are one word (i.e. sixty but 65)

  * top level headings within document should be at most `##` and decrease from there

  * avoid unnecessary blank lines
